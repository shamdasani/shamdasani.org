Part of being young is the ability to ideate and _execute_. Whether you're in college or just starting your career, the value of building projects is priceless. There's stakes are low, and you can literally do whatever you want.

However, many people — including myself — often have no idea where to start. Over the years, I've developed a framework for looking at opportunities (specifically technology-based projects & business ideas).

### The big idea

## Process

### Ideate

### Simplify

### Ship

### Repeat

<!--

——

many including myself did not know how to start

most importantly move fast and move smart -- keep on iterating within, launching out...show that you're improving -->
