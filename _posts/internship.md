## Background

In May 2018, I attended Apple's developer's conference ([WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc)) as a [student scholar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3Huqtw2log). For years, I had followed Apple keynotes and installed the [latest iOS betas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3mtgIvBElM); now, I had the chance to experience it in person â€” and meet so many incredibly talented people while I was at it.

During a lunch at the conference, I happened to sit next to one of these people: [Veeral](https://veeralpatel.com), a current Apple intern on the Shortcuts team. We kept in touch.

About a year later, Veeral updated me that he graduated school and was going to be joining a startup based in NYC as an early engineer.

I was honestly quite surprised. Why in the world would you want to go against [Brex](https://brex.com)? They had a two-year head start, were highly capitalized, and well on their way to breaking into the corporate card market. Turns out, there's always room at the table.

The competitor that Veeral joined is known as [Ramp](https://ramp.com).

Ramp is the corporate card and spend management platform built to help businesses save money. Its mission is to increase the lifespan of businesses. In less than two years, Ramp is a unicorn and has scaled to over a billion dollars in annualized transaction volume.

That's what I love about startups â€” you can never be too crazy. With the right idea and the right team, and there's nothing you can't do.

I had kept tabs on Ramp's product and once they launched the following year, I knew I was interested in learning more. After meeting everyone on the team through the interview process, it was clear that there was no other place I'd want to spend my summer more than Ramp.

## Upon reflection, this past summer was perhaps my most rewarding, high-impact, and exciting one yet.

Over the past three months, I've had the chance to work on many impactful features touching many different parts of our product.

**Shipping Information in the UI ðŸ“¦**

My first project involved standardizing shipping fulfillment data for physical cards from multiple data sources and displaying it on the Ramp dashboard.

**Faster Accounting âš¡**

Accounting is Ramp's superpower and one of the most-loved features of the product. Over my internship, I worked on a few accounting improvements:

- Searching and filtering transactions by chart of accounts on the Ramp dashboard
- Filtering by transactions ready to sync to accounting providers
- Standardizing sub-account and parent account formatting in drop-downs
- Ramp Auto Merchant Rule: matching to options in accounting provider automatically

**Filtering & Renaming GL ðŸ“ˆ**

My main internship project was also accounting-related. Our larger customers have _thousands_ of accounting options that a single cardholder could code a transaction to! Many options may contain sensitive information, lead to incorrect coding, or just clutter the overall UI.

With Filtering and Renaming GL, Ramp admins could toggle the visibility of any accounting option based on the cardholder's department within Ramp, both individually and in bulk. In addition, most of these option names in accounting providers are often long and cryptic. Now, admins could also rename them to something more readable within Ramp itself, saving everyone time and allowing finance teams to close their books even faster.
