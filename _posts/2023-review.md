This is my sixth [year-in-review](http://shamdasani.org/writing).

I write these mostly for myself. To document memories, to reflect on the year, and to say thank you.

## 2023

I officially entered 2023 as a college graduate[^1]. Three and a half years flew by way too fast. Finishing up classes meant I had a lot more (relative) free time on my hands.

During the first week of the new year, my senior year roommates and I flew to Switzerland for a [ski trip](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnQ8EuaJiLOz2279wRLNt6WY79wxf2UFSPWGl40/). Interlaken, Chamonix[^2], Geneva, and Zurich. It was such a blast. Thank you [Kalman](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=fs&competitorid=207088&type=result) for saving my life as we skied down [Les Grands Montets](https://www.montblancnaturalresort.com/en/domaine-skiable-grands-montets). That was one scary [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/8343178782?share_sig=0F89F4441703813367&utm_medium=social&utm_source=ios_share).

February was also packed with travel. Austin for a weekend with the [Contrary](https://contrary.com/) crew. Miami for a week to check out our new [Ramp](https://ramp.com/careers) office and hang out with the team. Costa Rica (La Fortuna & Tamarindo) for spring break. Wild-water rafting. Hiked around the Arenal volcano. Learned to surf for the first time. Pura Vida![^3]

Shortly after, SVB [blew up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank#:~:text=On%20March%2010%2C%202023%2C%20Silicon,2023%20in%20the%20United%20States.) and I was spending a lot of time on Twitter. Helped launch a quick [program](https://ramp.com/blog/supporting-business-banking-needs) for Ramp customers to get introductions to other reputable banking partners that weekend.

During this time, I also launched of one of the [largest changes to Ramp’s core product](https://twitter.com/samaysham/status/1643652753338540037). Since August 2022, [Jason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonscharff/) and I were heads down building a core layer of abstraction above physical and virtual cards—which later unlocked multiple features for Ramp moving upmarket into the enterprise ([spend limits](https://support.ramp.com/hc/en-us/articles/10881975647763-Card-Limits-and-Spend-Programs), [multi-currency limits](https://support.ramp.com/hc/en-us/articles/17748112010899-Multi-Currency-Limits-and-Programs#:~:text=Multi%2Dcurrency%20allows%20your%20team,to%20mentally%20convert%20from%20USD.))—and allowed us to win customers like [Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/ramp-expands-into-procurement-lands-shopify-as-a-customer/).

Life in Ann Arbor between my trips and work was fun—my weeks were mostly spent working out, supporting the [V1](https://v1michigan.com/) community, and just generally having a good time with friends. At the end of April, I formally walked at commencement and graduated with my class.

Over the next few months, I spent time working on multiple new projects at Ramp. A lot of the features I helped work on over this time ended up [shipping](https://ramp.com/blog/frictionless-expense-management-2024?utm_source=linkedin)[^4] a few months ago: [Expense Intelligence](https://ramp.com/intelligence) (AI-powered policy enforcement) with [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/~fe/) and smart routing (AI-powered spend limit routing) with [Jinyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jin-yi-li/) and [Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhang-danny/).

In July, I spent two weeks catching up with friends in San Francisco. That city never fails to energize me. Rode in a self-driving Waymo[^5] for the first time; so optimistic for the future.

At the end of the summer, I traveled to India (Mumbai, Nasik, Pune, Jaipur, Udaipur) with family. It’s been 11 years since I last visited and it was so good to get some refreshed [perspective](https://twitter.com/samaysham/status/1691146693272850432). We also traveled to Dubai[^6] after and indulged in all of its luxury before heading back home.

In September, I moved to New York City.

At the last minute, I jumped in and helped pull off running a fake restaurant ([Mehran’s Steak House](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/25/dining/nyc-best-fake-steakhouse.html))[^7]. That was by far one of the more crazier things I've been a part of. Massive respect to [Mehran](https://twitter.com/mehran__jalali) and [Riley](https://twitter.com/rtwlz) for making it happen and thanks to them for letting me help out!

In October, I flew to Budapest, Hungary[^8] for the [Stretch](https://stretchcon.com/2023) conference where I [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnkIMY7DM7o&list=PLcTa2e7_ENN-jaHtBTEXRPKNuBjMXm_xb) about engineering velocity. I also represented Ramp at [MHacks](<](https://www.mhacks.org/)>) in Ann Arbor later in November.

The final few weeks of the year were spent enjoying New York (runs, bike rides, concerts), meeting new people, and thinking deeply about my longer-term goals and how I want to get there.

If this year's theme was exploration (travel, learning, building), 2024 will be a **return to focus**. I'm eager to spend time learning figuring out what to focus on and then move incredibly fast[^9] on those priorities.

In short, 2023 was my best year yet[^10]. Thank you to everyone—my family, friends, mentors, peers, coworkers—for such a great year. I learned a lot about myself and the world around me.

Grateful and excited. It's been a great year—here's to the next!

[^1]: [1] I finished classes in December 2022 and received my diploma shortly after. However, I decided to stick around Ann Arbor and walk at commencement with my friends in April.
[^2]: [2] [Chamonix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamonix) was the site of the first winter olympics in 1924. Truly a quintessential ski town. One thing that surprised me was how affordable it was to ski in Europe compared to the United States. Lift tickets and rentals for two days cost me less than $200 USD.
[^3]: [3] Every local (and I mean literally every local) in Costa Rica greeted us with "Pura Vida"—we couldn't tell if they truly believed it or if everyone was all in on promoting it for the sake of driving tourism.
[^4]: [4] I recently became a manager (and tech lead) on the core spend management product. I've been doing a bit less IC work and focusing more on enabling others to grow and make an impact.
[^5]: [5] Thank you [Varun](https://varunshenoy.com/) for giving me a ride. I'm very jealous of your Waymo access.
[^6]: [6] Dubai almost seemed too good to be true. First class infrastructure, thriving economy, luxury living, & virtually zero crime ([x](https://twitter.com/samaysham/status/1692953561049481377)). It almost felt manufactured. I don't think I can live there, but I'd be open to visiting again.
[^7]: [7] Some more press: [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking/video/7282887766612987178?lang=en), [NY Post](https://nypost.com/2023/09/25/nycs-fine-dining-elite-pranked-by-gen-zers-fake-steakhouse/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/26/mehrans-steak-house-new-york-opening)
[^8]: [8] I stayed in Budapest for two days after the conference to explore the city—it was my first time solo traveling.
[^9]: [9] _"It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter."_ - Sam Altman. Also, when I do figure out what to focus on, it's mandatory to move [fast](https://patrickcollison.com/fast). [speed matters](https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters).
[^10]: [10] I often hear people reminisce about a past year (or set of years) as their absolute best: "college was the best four years of my life". Don't get me wrong. I absolutely loved my college experience, but I do not expect it to be the best four years of my life. I would like my life to be an [exponential curve](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful). More learning, more growth, more life. Each year better than the last.
