I love [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samaysham). It is, without a doubt, the social network I use the most often. A lot of my friends ask me about how I use Twitter and who to follow, so I figured I'd make a short guide.

### Why Twitter?

Twitter is where the world talks — thoughts are shared, news is spread, memes go viral. There's a lot of stuff going on, which means the site is really noisy and addictive.

However, Twitter is also the **fastest hack to leveling up**. Over the years, I've learned from hundreds of inspiring builders and investors. I've seen entrepreneurs grow their startup from the ground up to millions in recurring revenue. I've talked to incredible people through replying to tweets and DMs. I've seen friends get their dream job through Twitter. It sounds crazy, but I'm not sure I would be who I am today without using Twitter.

If you're interested in startups, venture capital, business, technology, or something adjacent, you _need_ to invest some time into Twitter. Even if you spend just a few minutes a day — if you follow the right people, you'll be blown away by how much value you'll get (and how the app is free!).

Let's get started.

### 1. Who to follow

My biggest tip here is following the right people. You don't want to waste your time, so follow people you find interesting or think you can learn something from. Here's my shortlist of some of the people I personally find the most interesting, sorted by category. These are by no means all of my favorites, just a select few that came to mind.

### 2. Building an audience

Great, you're now consuming a lot of content from the people who are the best at what they do. You're in the process of leveling up.

The next step is to build your own audience. You should share your superpower with the world and create your [personal monopoly](https://perell.com/note/build-a-personal-monopoly/). I'm not going to go into _why_ you should build an audience and create content, but it all comes down to your audience being your special advantage: you have the distribution to do whatever you want — launch a product, find talent, raise money, or virtually anything else you can think of.

> "Content builds on itself. It multiplies and compounds." - [Perell](https://perell.com/essay/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online/)

The only real way to grow an audience is to start sharing. Share anything. Share what makes you interesting. It could be graphic designs, your take on some news, a meme, I don't know — but make it interesting! Make it you. And then if others find it interesting too, double down on it! In my Twitter world, what makes people interesting is either their thoughts on a certain topic or industry, or what they're working on. Here's a [thread](https://twitter.com/samaysham/status/1360772448023633920) I made on SPACs while I was learning about them, and here's [another one](https://twitter.com/samaysham/status/1377659922071097348) about the time my side-project almost got sold to Microsoft for $30k. 

I'm still actively figuring out what makes me interesting, but that doesn't mean I give up on creating content. This post right here is a piece of content!

And on more thing: don't make it a task. Create content only when you want to. Only when you have an idea. But do it fast and don't lose momentum.

### 3. Engage & interact

This last step is really simple. Once you follow interesting people and share content yourself, you're ready to start interacting. Reply to tweets with your thoughts or shoot a quick DM to someone with a question or note — everyone loves to meet new people and I've personally made a lot of friends doing so!

**A note on balance —** try to not get addicted! Twitter is a lot of fun, but like everything, the returns diminish with respect to time spent on the app. On most days, I probably spend no more than an ~hour, but I'm trying to cut that down to maybe 30 minutes. Hope this helped!
