Well, here we are. Since this is so late, I'll keep it short and sweet. 

I'm 19. If last year meant I was turning an adult, this year was about having it sink in — especially after the months of staying home glued to a computer screen for school, work, & more. A lot of things changed this year. We experienced a pandemic, brought awareness to racial injustices, had an historic election, and so much more. But it's *comforting* to know that things are becoming more normal. 

In terms of metrics, I didn't run much — probably two to three hundred miles. I got lazy in quarantine. Most of my days were spent managing classes with side-projects, and consuming content online. Towards the end of the year, I started to get back into my a solid routine that balanced different aspects of my life. 

A short breakdown of my 2020: 

- January: Returned to school with a new type of energy, had a great second semester (or at least it was going well for the first few weeks...)
- March: spring break — invited some friends back home and we hung out in NYC. Great time.
- March: One week after spring break (mid-March), COVID sent us back home. Insane that only a few weeks ago we were talking about it, but no one had any idea how much it'd affect our lives.
- April: Finished school online — EECS 280, EECS 203, ECON 101, ENGR 100
- April: Brought on two cofounders to Enlight — Max & Varun — and we went through Georgia Tech's CREATE-X Startup Incubator over the summer. It was fun. We learned a lot. Over the course of the summer, we scaled the platform and launched our first revenue-generating product, Enlight Cohorts.
- April: Helped my parents launch an ecommerce store during the pandemic to offset its effects. It went really well, but growth is plateauing right now though.
- September: School started, virtual semester, continued working on Enlight
- December: School wrapped up — EECS 281, MATH 419, STATS 412, ENGLISH 325, holidays!

As much as I grew this year, I didn't make much progress on my goals. It's alright. It was a tough year, but I think I made the most of it. 

Here's to 2021.
